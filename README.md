# SermonChronicler
Preserving the Message. Deepening the Study.

SermonChronicler is an AI-driven tool designed to bridge the gap between hearing a sermon and truly studying it. Acting as a modern-day "ready writer," this tool takes raw sermon inputs and processes them into high-value spiritual resources.

Core Capabilities:
- Transcript Cleansing: Converts raw, conversational speech into readable, grammatically correct prose without losing the speaker's voice.
- Structural Note-Taking: Automatically generates organized outlines and key takeaways.
- Theological Analysis: Performs deep-dive keyword studies, linking vernacular terms to their biblical Hebrew or Greek roots with context.
- Designed for churches building content archives and individuals seeking a deeper Berean study of the word.
